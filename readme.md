This repository contains the Lua definitions for the Principia API. The
definitions are used by the code editor for that sweet, sweet autocompletion.

## Usage

To use the definitions with Visual Studio Code, clone this repository into the 
directory `.../Principia/cache/local/` where `...` is the directory where 
Principia stores local files. For me, this is 
`C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/Principia/`.
